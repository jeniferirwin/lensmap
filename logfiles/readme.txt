Put logfiles of atlas sessions here. To be used by the program, logs
must have at least one recognizable Coordinate/View pair, as detailed
in the main README.md.

You can make as many different logfiles as you want. Catching the same
View in two different logfiles is fine, but if you have mismatched
coordinates due to script issues, the 'bad' ones might overwrite the
accurate ones.
