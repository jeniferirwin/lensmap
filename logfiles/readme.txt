To be picked up by the program, logs need to be at least 15 lines long
and have at least one recognizable COORDINATE/View pair, as detailed in
the main README.md file.

You can make as many different logfiles as you want. Catching the same
View in two different logfiles is fine, but if you have mismatched
coordinates due to script issues, the 'bad' ones might overwrite the
accurate ones.
